# Big-data-flight-analysis
 
This project analyzes flight performance data using Hadoop-based Oozie workflows. Our focus is on optimizing workflows to derive insights such as on-time performance, taxi times, and cancellation analysis. The analysis spans 22 years of flight data, highlighting patterns and performance metrics across airlines and airports.

Features
On-time Performance Analysis: Identifies airlines with the highest and lowest punctuality rates.
Taxi Time Analysis: Calculates average taxi-in and taxi-out times for major airports.
Flight Cancellation Analysis: Examines reasons and rates of cancellations by airline. 


Key Findings
Top airlines for punctuality: WN, EA, AS.
Airports with the longest taxi-out times: ACK, SOP, BQN.
Most common cancellation reason: Carrier issues.
Technology Stack
Hadoop, Oozie
Python (Mappers/Reducers)
Distributed computing techniques
Usage
Clone the repository, and execute the workflows using the provided Oozie configuration files. Ensure a Hadoop environment is set up to process the dataset effectively.
